class Plane:
	'''
	Scene class to define a rectangular transducer plane from which rays are cast into space. One ray is cast per pixel. The imaging plane is defined by a focal point that lies behind the plane, a straight line distance from the focal point to the center of the imaging plane, an azimuth angle, a coelevation angle, vertical and horizontal resolutions, and vertical and horizontal number of pixels.
	IMPORTANT: I've assumed that the azimuth lies on the x-y plane, with x to the right, y coming out of the screen, and z pointing down (this is how one would see it when taking measurements). Equivalently, x can point to the right and y can point into the screen, meaning z points up. The coelevation is measured from the z axis and ranges from 0 to 180Â°.
	Additionally, offsets for the pixel centers are chosen so that they make more sense with an odd number of pixels in each axis. Lastly, some functions are left over from an optics implementation in which separate light source planes can be defined.
